Helper is a bot that helps me with basic administrative tasks.

Some Background:

I am the community leader for a local D&D group in the Detroit area: https://detroitlfg.com/
A big part of the community is players having the ability to schedule and join games whenever a Dungeon Master
is available. As such, there are periods of time where I get inundated with requests for people to be added to specific sessions
on the calendar. 

That's why helper was designed. Helper allows me to add and remove people to specific sessions with just a simple command


For Future development of helper, I'd like to connect him to a database and use him to collect metrics based on what events transpire in the community
